## Project Description: FoodFacts
Poor eating habits could be detrimental to a person's health, thus it is important to build a healthier eating habit, one of the ways towards it is by tracking calories and nutrients for each meal throughout the day. Then, come the question “How do you track calories and nutrients in your food easily?”. To answer that, we decided to develop an app that could detect the amount of calories and nutrients of food by taking pictures of it, then keep track of what kind of food you eat throughout the day.
